  p Oh hi there ðŸ‘‹
  p After a month of wanderous and adventureful experiences in USA, I finally set forth to the land of my forefathersâ€”the United Kingdom. Fun fact, I was talking to a lady in Scotland and she said there's a clan of Ryans up in Inverness. Maybe that's my home town!
  p I planned to stay in a smallish town in England with my friend John, but a couple of days after I got there we rented a big RV for a week and set out to tour the wilderness of Scotland.
