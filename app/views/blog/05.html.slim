  p Oh hi there ðŸ‘‹
  p The next stop is Austin, Texas. Leaving Chicago, it went down to -12ÂºC (I'm not sure what the Fahrenheit equivalent is, probably negative one million). 'Twas cold. But Texas brought me back to nice warm desert weather.

  h2 Priceless Bible
  p The university was near the house I stayed at, and guess what I found thereâ€”a Gutenberg Bible! (At the university, not the house). These bibles come in a two volume set, and a complete bible has an estimated worth of $35 million. 180 bibles were produced originally, of which 49 are known to still exist today, only 21 are complete.

  h2 Priceless People
  p Ok so what's more valuable than a $35 million dollar bible? Spending time at the university campus with students and dear saints who love and serve the Lord full-time ðŸ˜‰.

  p Song timeâ€”I really enjoyed singing on campus, you can watch a short vid of this #{link_to "here", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BtHiVQLBoMS/", target: "_blank"}.

  h2 Food
  p Food timeâ€”had one of the best pizzas ever. Seriously. So good that I had to record all the ingredients because this magic should be documented and distributed far and wide:
  ul
    li Thin Italian crust
    li Tomato paste
    li Spinach
    li Mozzarella
    li Parmesan
    li Pepperoni
    li Red onion
    li Roasted red pepper
    li Balsamic vinegar
    li Chili flakes
  p Also, I was near Mexico, so, tacos al pastor!! Hadn't had these babies since 2012 ðŸ¤¤

  h2 Guns
  p Since I was in Texas, I went to a gun range. This was somewhat scary/humbling/sobering with a hint of cool. You squeeze a trigger with a tiny bit of effortâ€”you're not sure when exactly something will happenâ€”and then suddenly there's a small explosion, and the power to take somebody's life jumps out of the gun and into whatever you were pointing at. Funny story: a bunch of guys went, as well as one girl who thought "shooting" meant laser tag ðŸ˜… big props to her for going ahead with it. Everyone was cheering her on.

  p Oh and guess who I ran into in Austin? Why, my boy Lincoln from Houston! I met this guy in Israel last year. Pretty cool how small the world is.

  p Ok so I've been saving the best for lastâ€”over the past week I played a lot of Smash Bros with college students. I lost pretty much straight away, pretty much every time. But finally, I won!!
